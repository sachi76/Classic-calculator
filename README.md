# Classic-calculator

Hi, this is a simple Calculator that is build on HTML and CSS

We can note that the app has been created without using Javascript file. 

Logic has been written inside HTML file itself where onClick event is used.

However, we can make use of javascript file and bring in the addEventListener() method as well.

Also we can note that using eval() method we will be able to perform mathematical operation

NOTE:
eval(): This function was used to evaluate a string as JavaScript code, but it is now considered deprecated because it can introduce security vulnerabilities and is often unnecessary
